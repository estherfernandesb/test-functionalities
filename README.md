# Test Test Boom!!!

## This small project was developed in _30 minutes_ by me during my internship at Jitterbit. The goal was to test my skills as a Front-end programmer.

## **1. HTML:**
The website design is very simple, the idea was to make it look like a `visual bug`.
So, I created a background with the word "Test" in Portuguese repeated thousands of times.
I used HTML to define my header and my button.

## **1.1. CSS:**
I used CSS to style my page and make it even more interactive and intuitive, despite the initial intention of making it look like a `visual bug`.

## **1.2. JavaScript:**
JavaScript was crucial for creating the loop that allows me to repeat or give up on the explosion.
I didn't use a conditional statement; in this case, using a switch and a while loop seemed simpler and more effective.
I created two functions: one that lets the user know they are being tested and another that displays the explosion.

## **Conclusion:**
This simple website serves only as a test of functionalities and knowledge. It serves as a playful experiment: _You can choose whether to explode or not._
